# Physical Computing
## Whisper Phone 

Whisper Phone, a collaboration with David Yang,  is a physical computing art installation that creates a two-person experience of a phone call, communicated with breath instead of voice. We chose breath as a form of communication that is both intimate and indecipherable, and lost with the use of face masks, social distancing, and other physical barriers. The project takes the form of two full-size phone booths, using four Bluetooth-connected Arduino Nanos to capture a microphone input from a user’s phone, and translate it into a stream of air into the other user’s ear. The project was selected for the ITP/IMA Winter Show 2021.
